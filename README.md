# Educational Technology Plan

## Context

Students will participate in an after school coding club once a week for 3 months. The course will be 1 hour long. For many students, this is the first time ever working with coding. 

### Course

The course will be called Coding Club. Students in 4th and 5th grade, with no prior experience will learn the basics of coding on scratch and Python. 

### Situation

Students are all provided with a Chromebook from the school district. They have access to relevant sites but are blocked from others. Scratch is accessable only through google search and blocked when typing the address directly into the browser. 

This is a Title 1 school and all students are on free lunch. 

Due to a high amount of migrancy during COVID, there are more behavior problems that have arised.

Students who participate in coding club must have both parent permission and teacher recommendation. Behavior students should not be permitted as time will be taken away from other students. 

Many of the students are bellow grade level academically.

The school is an AVID school. AVID is a college readiness program that is elementary school, helps students plan for college, be efficient note takers, and become organzied.

The school is a PBIS school. PBIS is a program that focuses on positive behavor to reward students. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

* Google Classroom
  Google Classroom is a Google Suite program utilized by the school district that allows assignments, discussion, and work to be posted for both students and     educators. Once the students are connected on Google Classroom, user name import becomes easier for students as they can log into google instead of remembering passwords.
* Scratch.mit.edu
    Scratch is a website that allows student to use block coding. Students can create an account and build a game on this website without having to download. 
* codehs.com
    Code HS is a website that allows students safe access to Python online. It has built in coding lessons that we will not be utilizing in this club.

### Hardware Specifications

The club will have between 15 and 24 students based on interest and 1 teacher.

Students will be using Asys Chromebooks. 

### Application

Students will learn the basics of coding in their three months in the club. 

They will spend 4 weeks on scratch, writing basic games and learning about how the coordingate grid is importand to movement on the the program. Students will learn the importance of loops and how to move a sprite using atonomus control and player control.

4 weeks will be spent on python learning how to create while loops and if/ then sentences. Students will take the knowedge theTime will be spent on understanding functions, strings, and coordinate graphs. The last two weeks of the club will be spent on a project of the student's choosing. The will create a comulating project that will showcase what they have learned. They will share this with their classmates, teachers, and other staff at the school. Per availabilty and COVID restictrictions, students will be given the opportunity to attend a fieldtrip at the conclusion of the course to Legoland to take part in the robotics course and to celebrate their accomplishments in the club.

All work will be completed in class. Students will use their Chromebooks to log onto the webites to complete the assignments. This is an optional club that is done on the student's time. For this reason, homework or outside club time work will not be required.

### Impacts

Students who are club attendees will learn the basics of coding that can be applied to middle school coding classes if they wish to continue their studies in that direction. This club is a taste and a step into the world of coding for these students, often the first time they are exposed to it. Discussions involving careers in coding will hopefully create future opportunities for career choices.
